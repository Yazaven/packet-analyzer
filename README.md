# packet analyzer

This is a packet analyzer I built in my spare time using C++ and Linux raw sockets. It makes use of multithreading to handle both the GUI and performance efficiently.
The tool is designed to intercept and analyze network traffic on a Linux system. By working with raw sockets, it captures packets at a low level before they're processed by higher-level protocols giving you a detailed view of the network data as it flows through the system.
