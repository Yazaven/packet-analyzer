# packet analyzer

This is a packet analyzer I developed during my spare time. It's constructed utilizing C++ and Linux raw sockets, leveraging multithreading for GUI and performance. Continuing with the description, this packet analyzer is designed to intercept and analyze network traffic passing through a Linux system. It utilizes raw sockets to access network data at a low level, allowing it to capture packets before they are processed by higher-level protocols.
